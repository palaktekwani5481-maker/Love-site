<h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, My Love ❤️</h1>

<p>
I don’t even know where to start,
because our story feels like something I never planned,
but something I’m so grateful for.<br><br>

When we first started talking,
I was in Ahmedabad and you were in Jaipur.
Miles apart, yet somehow,
you felt closer than anyone ever had.<br><br>

You were flirting with me,
and I remember blushing all the time.
We talked till 4–5 in the morning,
every single day,
losing track of time like the world didn’t exist beyond us.<br><br>

You were careless in your own way,
childish, cute, and so full of charm.
You complimented me so much,
made me feel seen, wanted, and special.
And somewhere between those late-night talks,
I fell in love with you.<br><br>

We started dating on 20th June,
and from that day,
you made me feel good in ways I didn’t even know I needed.<br><br>

I miss you.
I love you.
And I choose you. Always. ❤️
